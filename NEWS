  Use create_list in step definitions

    more convenient way to interact with the result than using Object.tap.
  Standardize deprecation warnings
  Update transient attribute syntax to use blocks instead of calling ignore on
    each attribute declaration
  Parents can be defined after children because factories are evaluated when
    they're used; this means breaking up factories across multiple files will
    behave as expected

    handful of methods for a more clearly defined API
