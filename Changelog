2.2.0 (October 14, 2011)
  Clean up RSpec suite to not use 'should'
  Use create_list in step definitions
  Syntax methods that deal with ORM interaction (attributes_for, build, build_stubbed,
    and create) now accept a block that yields the result. This results in a
    more convenient way to interact with the result than using Object.tap.
  Standardize deprecation warnings
  Update transient attribute syntax to use blocks instead of calling ignore on
    each attribute declaration
  Parents can be defined after children because factories are evaluated when
    they're used; this means breaking up factories across multiple files will
    behave as expected
  Large internal refactoring, including changing access modifiers for a
    handful of methods for a more clearly defined API

2.1.2 (September 23, 2011)
  Bugfix: Vintage syntax fixed after bug introduced in 2.1.1

2.1.0 (September 02, 2011)
  Bugfix: created_at now defined for stubbed models

  All factories can now be reloaded with Factory.reload
  Add :method => build to factory associations to prevent saving of associated objects
  Factories defined in {Rails.root}/factories are now loaded by default
  Various documentation updates

1.1.4 (November 28, 2008)
  Factory.build now uses Factory.create for associations of the built object
  Factory definitions are now detected in subdirectories, such as

		(fixes some issues with dependencies being loaded too early) (thanks to
