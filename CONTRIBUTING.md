  other details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including your gem
  version, Ruby version, and operating system.

## Cleaning up issues

* Issues that have no response from the submitter will be closed after 30 days.
* Issues will be closed once they're assumed to be fixed or answered. If the
  maintainer is wrong, it can be opened again.

### Notes

* Please add tests if you changed code. Contributions without tests won't be accepted.

## Running the test suite

The default rake task will run the full test suite and [standard]:

```sh
bundle exec rake
```

You can also run a single group of tests (unit, spec, or feature)

```sh
bundle exec rake spec:unit
bundle exec rake spec:acceptance
bundle exec rake features
```

To run an individual rspec test, you can provide a path and line number:

```sh
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/spec.rb:123
```

You can run tests with a specific version of rails via [appraisal]. To run
the default rake task against Rails 6, for example:

```sh
bundle exec appraisal 6.0 rake
```

## Formatting

Use [standard] to automatically format your code:

```sh
bundle exec rake standard:fix
```
