# Intro

factory_bot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax,
support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances,
attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for
the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

Its documentation is split as such:

- the [guide](setup/summary.html) is a great place to start for first-time users.
- the [cookbook](cookbook/has_many-associations.html) is the go-to place for creative solutions to common situations.
- the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/wiki) details considerations for integrating with other software.
- the [reference](ref/build-strategies.html) is terse facts for those who use this project often.
