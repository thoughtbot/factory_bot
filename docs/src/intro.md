# Intro

factory_bot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax;
support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances,
attribute hashes, and stubbed objects); and support for multiple factories for
the same class (`:user`, `:admin_user`, and so on), including factory inheritance.

This book contains the following sections:

- The [guide](setup/summary.md) is a great place to start for first-time users.
- The [reference](ref/build-strategies.md) contains terse facts for those who use this project often.
- The [cookbook](cookbook/has_many-associations.md) is the go-to place for creative solutions to common situations.

The [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/wiki) details considerations for integrating with other software.
