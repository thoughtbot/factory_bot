# Why is this project called "Factory Bot"?

The name "Factory Bot" might be confusing to some developers who encounter this
library. This library used to be called "Factory Girl" but was renamed in October 2017. 
A discussion of the reasons behind this decision can be found 
[here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/issues/921).

[We chose the name](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/waiting-for-a-factory-girl) as
a nod in the direction of the [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
and [Object Mother](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) software
patterns from the _Design Patterns_ book, and as a reference to the
[Rolling Stones song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jKix2DFlnA) of the same
name.
