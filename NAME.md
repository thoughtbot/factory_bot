# Project Naming History

## Factory Girl

This library was [initially released](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/waiting-for-a-factory-girl)
in 2008 with the name "Factory Girl".

We chose the name as a nod in the direction of the [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)
and [Object Mother](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) software
patterns from the _Design Patterns_ book, and as a reference to the
[Rolling Stones song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jKix2DFlnA) of the same
name.

## Factory Bot

The name "Factory Girl" was confusing to some developers who encountered this
library, and offensive or problematic to others. In October 2017 we [renamed the library](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/factory_bot)
to "Factory Bot".
