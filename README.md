# factory_bot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/factory_bot.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/factory_bot?branch=master) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/factory_bot/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/factory_bot)

factory_bot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

If you want to use factory_bot with Rails, see
[factory_bot_rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails).

Transitioning from factory\_girl?
-------------

Upgrading your codebase should involve only a few steps, and in most cases, it involves updating the Gemfile, factories file(s), and support file configuring the testing framework.

Transitioning is a two step process:

1) Replace `factory_girl` with `factory_bot` in your Gemfile and `bundle install`

2) Rename all `FactoryGirl` to `FactoryBot` and `factory_girl` to `factory_bot` in your codebase.


### 1. Modify your Gemfile

Replace references to factory_girl_rails or factory_girl with factory_bot_rails or factory_bot. Both new gems are available starting at version 4.8.2.

Gemfile

```ruby
# old
group :development, :test do
  gem "factory_girl_rails"
  # or
  gem "factory_girl"
end

# new
group :development, :test do
  gem "factory_bot_rails"
  # or
  gem "factory_bot"
end

# Don't forget to bundle install!

```

### 2. Renaming All Constant References

A global find-and-replace of FactoryGirl to FactoryBot across the codebase to replace all references with the new constant should do the trick. 

```ruby 
# e.g. on OS X:
grep -e FactoryGirl **/*.rake **/*.rb -l | xargs sed -i "" "s|FactoryGirl|FactoryBot|"

# e.g. on Linus (Ubuntu):
find . -name \*.rb -exec sed -i "s/FactoryGirl/FactoryBot/g" {} \;
```

### 3. Replace All Path References

If you're requiring files from factory_girl or factory_girl_rails directly, you'll have to update the paths.

```ruby
## e.g. OS X
grep -e factory_girl **/*.rake **/*.rb -l | xargs sed -i "" "s|factory_girl|factory_bot|"

## e.g. Ubuntu:
find . -name \*.rb -exec sed -i "s/factory_girl/factory_bot/g" {} \;
```

### 4. Use Grep to check for no remaining instances:

`grep -r -l 'FactoryGirl'`

and:

`grep -r -l 'factory_girl'`

You should see no remaining instances. If you do, then go ahead and replace them.

Documentation
-------------

You should find the documentation for your version of factory_bot on [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/factory_bot).

See [GETTING_STARTED] for information on defining and using factories. We also
have [a detailed introductory video][], available for free on Upcase.

Install
--------

Add the following line to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'factory_bot'
```

and run `bundle install` from your shell.

To install the gem manually from your shell, run:

```shell
gem install factory_bot
```

**Caveat:** As of ActiveSupport 5.0 and above, Ruby 2.2.2+ is required. Because
of Rubygems' dependency resolution when installing gems, you may see an error
similar to:

```
$ gem install factory_bot
ERROR:  Error installing factory_bot:
    activesupport requires Ruby version >= 2.2.2.
```

To bypass this, install a pre-5.0 version of ActiveSupport before installing
manually.

Supported Ruby versions
-----------------------

The factory_bot 3.x+ series supports MRI Ruby 1.9. Additionally, factory_bot
3.6+ supports JRuby 1.6.7.2+ while running in 1.9 mode. See [GETTING_STARTED]
for more information on configuring the JRuby environment.

For versions of Ruby prior to 1.9, please use factory_bot 2.x.
