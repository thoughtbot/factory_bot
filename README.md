# factory_bot [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci] [![Code Climate][grade-image]][grade] [![Gem Version][version-image]][version]

factory_bot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

If you want to use factory_bot with Rails, see
[factory_bot_rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails).
