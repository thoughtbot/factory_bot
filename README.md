# factory_bot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/factory_bot.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/factory_bot?branch=master) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/factory_bot/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/factory_bot)

factory_bot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including factory inheritance.

If you want to use factory_bot with Rails, see
[factory_bot_rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails).

**A historical note:** factory_bot used to be named factory_girl. An explanation of the name change can be found in the [old factory_girl repository](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl).

Documentation

You should find the documentation for your version of factory_bot on [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/factory_bot).

Install
--------

Add the following line to Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'factory_bot'
```

and run `bundle install` from your shell.

To install the gem manually from your shell, run:

```shell
gem install factory_bot
```

**Caveat:** As of ActiveSupport 5.0 and above, Ruby 2.2.2+ is required. Because
of Rubygems' dependency resolution when installing gems, you may see an error
similar to:

```
$ gem install factory_bot
ERROR:  Error installing factory_bot:
    activesupport requires Ruby version >= 2.2.2.
```

To bypass this, install a pre-5.0 version of ActiveSupport before installing
manually.

Supported Ruby versions
-----------------------

The factory_bot 3.x+ series supports MRI Ruby 1.9. Additionally, factory_bot
3.6+ supports JRuby 1.6.7.2+ while running in 1.9 mode. See [GETTING_STARTED]
for more information on configuring the JRuby environment.

For versions of Ruby prior to 1.9, please use factory_bot 2.x.
