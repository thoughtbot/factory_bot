    # Generates an association using the current build strategy.
    #
    # Arguments:
    #   name: (Symbol)
    #     The name of the factory that should be used to generate this
    #     association.
    #   attributes: (Hash)
    #     A hash of attributes that should be overridden for this association.
    #
    # Returns:
    #   The generated association for the current build strategy. Note that
    #   associations are not generated for the attributes_for strategy. Returns
    #   nil in this case.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   factory :user do
    #     # ...
    #   end
    #
    #   factory :post do
    #     # ...
    #     author { |post| post.association(:user, :name => 'Joe') }
    #   end
    #
    #   # Builds (but doesn't save) a Post and a User
    #   FactoryGirl.build(:post)
    #
    #   # Builds and saves a User, builds a Post, assigns the User to the
    #   # author association, and saves the Post.
    #   FactoryGirl.create(:post)
    #
    def association(name, overrides = {})
