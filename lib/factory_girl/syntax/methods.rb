module FactoryGirl
  module Syntax
    ## This module is a container for all strategy methods provided by
    ## FactoryGirl. This includes all the default strategies provided ({Methods#build},
    ## {Methods#create}, {Methods#build_stubbed}, and {Methods#attributes_for}), as well as
    ## the complementary *_list methods.
    ## @example singular factory execution
    ##   # basic use case
    ##   build(:completed_order)
    ##
    ##   # factory yielding its result to a block
    ##   create(:post) do |post|
    ##     create(:comment, post: post)
    ##   end
    ##
    ##   # factory with attribute override
    ##   attributes_for(:post, title: "I love Ruby!")
    ##
    ##   # factory with traits and attribute override
    ##   build_stubbed(:user, :admin, :male, name: "John Doe")
    ##
    ## @example multiple factory execution
    ##   # basic use case
    ##   build_list(:completed_order, 2)
    ##   create_list(:completed_order, 2)
    ##
    ##   # factory with attribute override
    ##   attributes_for_list(:post, 4, title: "I love Ruby!")
    ##
    ##   # factory with traits and attribute override
    ##   build_stubbed_list(:user, 15, :admin, :male, name: "John Doe")
