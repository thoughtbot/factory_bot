        # * name: +Symbol+ or +String+
        #   A unique name used to identify this factory.
        # * options: +Hash+
        #
        # Options:
        # * class: +Symbol+, +Class+, or +String+

        #   The parent factory. If specified, the attributes from the parent
        #   factory will be copied to the current one with an ability to override
        #   them.
        #

        #   aliases. Contents captured in the pattern can be used in the alias.
