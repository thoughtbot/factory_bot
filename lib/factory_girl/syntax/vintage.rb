        #   factory will be copied to the current one with an ability to override
        #   them.

        #   The strategy that will be used by the Factory shortcut method.

        #     generated. The block should return the generated value for the

        #   aliases. Contents captured in the pattern can be used in the alias.
        # * replace: +String+
        #   The alias that results from the matched pattern. Captured strings can
        #   be substituted like with +String#sub+.
        #
        # Example:
        #
        #   Factory.alias /(.*)_confirmation/, '\1'
        #
