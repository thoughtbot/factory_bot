## Looking Ahead

- [[Using Traits as Implicit Attributes]] 
  *covers how [[§ traits|Traits]] can be used as [[§ attributes|Attributes]]*
- [[Using Sequences Within Attributes]]
  *covers to learn how [[§ sequences|Sequences]] can be used within [[Dynamic Attributes]]*
- [[Using Sequences As Implicit Attributes]]
  *covers how a [[§ sequences|Sequence]] can be used as an [[Implicit Attribute]]*
