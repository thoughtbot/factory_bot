# FactoryBot

`factory_bot` is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax;
support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances,
attribute hashes, and stubbed objects); and support for multiple factories for
the same class (`:user`, `:admin_user`, and so on), including factory inheritance.

## 🧠 Brainstorming

the original docs...

- were organized by details
- as a beginner, its hard to find your way through it
- https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/issues/1707
    - there is no section in the README to help beginners with the basics
- https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/issues/1671
    - this is a request to bring back the old GETTING_STARTED readme-style document that has been deprecated.
    - new docs are split up too granularly
    - scrolling and scanning through the old document was helpful and fun

organizing by how the developer uses it... and concepts...


new things to add

- examples section
- man pages have an example section

other thoughts

- it's very much sliced by tech level
- Summer mentioned its organized to make it easier to add new documentation
- not very beginner friendly at the moment
- what is a callback? what is a sequence? what are these things I'm seeing in the index or page listing?
- the README is even not scannable in the git repo

complaints / issues with existing documentation
