# FactoryBot

## Introduction

`factory_bot` is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax;
support for multiple [[§ strategies|construction strategies]] ([[create Strategy|saved instances]], [[build Strategy|unsaved instances]],
[[attributes_for Strategy|attribute hashes]], and [[build_stubbed Strategy|stubbed objects]]); and support for multiple factories for
the same class (`:user`, `:admin_user`, and so on), including factory inheritance.
